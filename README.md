# primoHalloween2017
Our set up with the features (clickable logo, altered colors, dropdown on left, bring back scopes for basic searches)
I'm also experimenting with adding a fixed header, which will bring over the "look and feel" from our library's website. 
I'd also like to add a chat box to all the pages in Primo.
